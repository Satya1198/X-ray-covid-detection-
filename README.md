# X-ray-covid-detection-
SO why people started doing machine learning research on x-ray's . In 2020 people have faces the covid across the globe . In covid people had fever, losing senstivity , chest pain, breathing issue etc. So researcher have started developing a model that could diagonise covid using chest x-ray so it really helped across the globe. 

 # PROBLEM:-
       DETECT COVID-19 USING X-RAY IMAGES 
# COMMENT:-
    I WILL BE USING X-RAY DATASET THAT CONTAINS IMAGES OF NORMAL AND COVID PATIENT'S .
    HERE WE WILL USE CNN MODULE THAT IS VASTLY USE IN IMAGE CLASSFICATION , LETS WRITE SOME STEPS THAT I WILL USING ...
     1- TENSORFLOW
     2- ACCURACY CHECK
     3- PLOT THOSE ACCURACY AND LOSS
     4- EVALUATE THE MODEL 
     5- TEST THE MODEL

# IF ANYONE SEEMS TO CORRECT MY MODEL THAN PLEASE LET ME KNOW , LETS ALL LEARN AND GROW TOGETHER..
